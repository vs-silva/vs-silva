👋 Hi, I'm a Senior JavaScript Engineer with 10+ years of experience building scalable, testable, and modular web applications using React, Vue, and Node.js.

🔍 I specialize in software architecture with Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters), and I’m a strong advocate of Test-Driven Development (TDD). My focus is on delivering clean, maintainable code that scales with business needs.

🛠️ Core strengths:
- Full-stack JavaScript (MERN & Vue stacks)
- RESTful & GraphQL API integrations
- Scalable frontend architecture (React + Redux Toolkit / Vue + Pinia)
- Backend systems with Node.js, Express, and RabbitMQ
- CI/CD pipelines, testing (Jest, RTL, Vue Test Utils), and DevOps fundamentals

📦 I build from scratch, modernize legacy codebases, and contribute to high-impact projects that demand technical excellence and business value.
